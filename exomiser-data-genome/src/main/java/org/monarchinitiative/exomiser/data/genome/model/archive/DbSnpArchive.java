 * AlleleArchive for dbSNP build 152+. These are named using the RefSeq accession for each assembly e.g.
 * GCF_000001405.25.gz (GRCh37.p12) or GCF_000001405.38.gz (GRCh38.p13). Annoyingly the broke the tradition of 20 years
 * and removed the .vcf part of the file extension so this new and special class was needed to replace the {@link TabixArchive}
